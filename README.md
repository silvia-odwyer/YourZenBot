# YourZenBot
A basic Discord bot that sends you wise messages when you ask for them.

Do you want to inject some extra positivity into your Discord life or gaming?
Feeling stuck at a certain level in a game?
Just ask YourZenBot for advice! This basic Discord bot can be both your confidant and your Magic 8 ball, as it divulges truths and pieces of wisdom to you. While its wisdom is simple, it's often the simple things in life that pack the greatest punch.
For example, if you type !wisewords, YourZenBot will output a piece of wisdom to you, such as: "Don't worry about tomorrow! :) It will sort out itself."

This bot uses the Discord.py Library, and can be ran from any terminal once you download the Discord.py Library and have Python installed on your PC.

[WORK IN PROGRESS] -- This is in development stages, but I am always working on it, so every day or so, you should expect to find new updates on the source code.
