# YourZenBot
A basic Discord bot that acts as a Magic 8 Ball/fortune cookie, and provides little pieces of wisdom when you ask for them.

## What Is YourZenBot?
YourZenBot is a Discord bot written using the Discord.py Library that can send you clues on what your future holds, answer some yes-or-no style questions, and give pieces of wisdom. 

Do you want to inject some extra positivity into your Discord life or gaming?

Feeling stuck on a certain level in a game?

Just ask YourZenBot for advice! This basic Discord bot can be both your confidant and your Magic 8 ball, as it divulges truths and pieces of wisdom to you. While its wisdom is simple, it's often the simple things in life that pack the greatest punch.

## Commands 
`!fortune`	-> Get a prediction on what the next few days could hold.

`!future`		-> Same as the !fortune command.

`!question`	-> The bot will prompt you for a YES or NO-style question. Ask your question and get an answer.

`!wisewords`	-> Get a little piece of wisdom for the day.

`!day`		-> Tells you if today is a National Day or if the day is commemorating anything special. This can be useful for sparking conversations on a server!

## Examples Of YourZenBot In Action
You can use `!fortune` to get a small prediction on what tomorrow holds.

Or if you want to ask the bot a question, just type `!question`

If you type `!wisewords`, YourZenBot will output a piece of wisdom to you, such as: "Don't worry about tomorrow! :) It will sort out itself."

## How To Use YourZenBot
### What do you need?
1. Python 
2. Discord.py Library
3. A Discord Client ID

This bot uses the Discord.py Library. 

1. So firstly, you need to download the Discord.py Library by going to any Python terminal, 
and typing the following:
`python3 -m pip install -U discord.py `

2. Then, go to: 
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

Click on "Make App". Once the page has loaded, click on the option that allows you to make a bot. Call the bot "YourZenBot". 

3. Invite the bot you created to your server by replacing INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your bot's client ID: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0

4. Then, download my YourZenBot.py file, and paste your TOKEN ID into the last line of my YourZenBot.py file. 

5. Open a terminal and run the Python file. 

6. Open Discord and add the bot to your server. You're now good to go! :)

## Quick Note
[WORK IN PROGRESS] -- This is still in development. The bot will always work in its current state, 
but just keep in mind that new features are continually being added to the bot. So make sure to drop by whenever you can!
